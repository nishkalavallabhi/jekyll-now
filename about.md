I am an NLP researcher based in Toronto, Canada. I work on problems related to processing and understanding text, using machine learning methods. I used to teach at Iowa State University, USA in the past (2016-18) and worked as a data scientist in Toronto for sometime (2018-19). This blog consists of my reflections on teaching NLP to different audiences, past and current reading summaries, general NLP related articles and other such stuff. My personal blog is at: https://vbsowmya.wordpress.com/
